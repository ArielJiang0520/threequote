Root cause: Cloudflare can make it hard to identify the originating IP address of a request.","Quote Tweet

Added multi-currency support to http://LanguaTalk.com based on the user's location. Hoping this provides clarity on pricing, instills trust in our platform, and improves conversions for our global users.
